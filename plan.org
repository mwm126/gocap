[ ] Is packet correct?
[x] Can tunnel port LOCALP:REMOTEH:REMOTEP?
 + Run sshd localhost:22
 + Run ssh localhost:22
 * Run capclient 2222:localhost:22
 * Run ssh localhost:2222

[x] Can Spawn tunnel from GUI ?

Yes; can open gnome-terminal with SSH inside it.

Can I use sshtunnel to open forwards from localhost:10022?
Or do I need to use the same crypto/ssh/Session object?
