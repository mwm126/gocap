#+TITLE: Development Plan

* TODO items
[ ] Is packet correct?
[x] Can tunnel port LOCALP:REMOTEH:REMOTEP?
 + Run sshd localhost:22
 + Run ssh localhost:22
 * Run capclient 2222:localhost:22
 * Run ssh localhost:2222

[x] Can Spawn tunnel from GUI on Linux?

Yes; can open gnome-terminal with SSH inside it.

Can I use sshtunnel to open forwards from localhost:10022?
Or do I need to use the same crypto/ssh/Session object?

[ ] Can Spawn tunnel from GUI on Windows?
Not yet.  How does Putty figure into things?

* Save list of forwards
** Read capclient.toml file on startup (if exists)
** (Over)Write capclient.toml file on startup (log warning if already exists, but reading failed)
** Start SSH forwards (on startup)
** Start SSH forward (When updating Forward List)
** End SSH forward (When removing from Forward List)
* SSH GUI
** On Windows, Download Putty.exe automatically
** If On Ubuntu, use if x-terminal-emulator
** On other Linux, check if gnome-terminal exists (before enabling New Session button)
** On Mac, ????
* File Transfer GUI (TODO)
* Joule Launch VNC (TODO)
* Watt Launch Web Interface (TODO)
